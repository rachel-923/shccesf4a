<p>My name is Rachel He. I’m a 15-year-old Macau girl studying at Sacred Heart Canossian College(English Section). There are four members in my family, my sister, me, my mom and my dad. Besides, I own a male cat which is really adorable and fat. I am the President of the Science Club in our school, which enables me to acquire more scientific knowledge and train my co-operation skills with other officers as well as my leadership. My favourite subjects are Biology and Chemistry. Moreover, I am currently learning clarinet and French from the organizations outside of the school. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends, eating spicy food, sometimes staying at home watching TV dramas or reading.That’s all about me, thanks for reading and have a nice day!</p>
